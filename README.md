## Overview

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical imaging has become a critical tool for diagnosis. This project leverages the power of deep learning to assist healthcare professionals in identifying COVID-19 cases in chest X-ray images. The VGG16 architecture is chosen for its proven effectiveness in image classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is [provide the source or link to the dataset], which contains a diverse collection of chest X-ray images, including COVID-19 positive and negative cases. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets to ensure model robustness.

## Model Architecture

We utilized a pre-trained VGG16 model as the backbone for this classification task. The model was fine-tuned on our dataset and achieved excellent performance. Details on the model's architecture and how to reproduce the training process can be found in the [model directory](model/).

## Usage

To use the trained model for COVID-19 classification or to train your own model, follow the instructions in the [Usage Guide](docs/usage_guide.md). This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your environment, preprocess data, and train the model.

## Results

Our trained model achieved a [mention your model's accuracy, F1 score, or other relevant metrics] on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in COVID-19 detection. You can find more detailed performance metrics in the [results directory](results/).
